Do the below
#0 - Create a virtual env for the project
#1 - Django Model for categories
#2 - Django Model for Subcategories linked to categories
#3 - Django Model for storing products with linked Subcategories
#4 - API to get all categories
#5 - API to get subcategories for a category
#6 - API to get all products for a category
#7 - API to get all products for a subcategory
#8 - API to post new product under existing subcategory and category
#9 - Develop a single responsive webpage. (You can use any frontend library/framework, it would be
great if you can use ReactJs + Ant.design)
The grid should show each product with its sub category and category mentioned. Each column should
be sortable in ascending and descending order.
Add button adds a product to the list with category and subcategory as drop-down
The page should not reload in either of the operation.
For test data

- use Django admin to add 2 categories, 4 sub categories to each category
- 5 products in each sub category
  Once project is done, upload it to github and share
